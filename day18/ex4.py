In the flood of darkness, hope is the light. It brings comfort, faith, and confidence. It gives us guidance when we are lost, and gives support when we are afraid. And the moment we give up hope, we give up our lives. The world we live in is disintegrating into a place of malice and hatred, where we need hope and find it harder. In this world of fear, hope to find better, but easier said than done, the more meaningful life of faith will make life meaningful.
Only when you understand the true meaning of life can you live truly. Bittersweet as life is, it's still wonderful, and it's fascinating even in tragedy. If you're just alive, try harder and try to live wonderfully.
Sometimes we think of dreams as fantasies - it's easy to do when you have money, rent, and work. But you can't prepare yourself and jump off the cliff: you should grow your wings first. A little bit toward the dream. Step by step. Take a step forward. After all, it's your mission.
No one can help others as much as you do. No one can express himself like you. No one can express what you want to convey. No one can comfort others in your own way. No one can be as understanding as you are. No one can feel happy, carefree, and no one can smile as much as you do. In a word, no one can show your features to anyone else.
Keep faith and hope for the future. Make your most sincere dreams, and when the opportunities come, they will fight for them. It may take a season or more, but the ending will not change. Ambition, best, become a reality. An uncertain future, only one step at a time, the hope can realize the dream of the highest. We must treasure the dream, to protect it a season, let it in the heart quietly germinal. However, we have to gently protect our hearts deep expectations, slowly dream, will achieve new life.
